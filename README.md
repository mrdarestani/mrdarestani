👋🏽 Hello, I’m Reza Darestani 👨🏽‍🔬💡
A passionate engineer, educator, and innovator on a mission to build life-changing technologies.

I'm an Electrical and Biomedical Engineer with 10+ years of experience in hardware design, embedded systems, product development, and research. I've developed wearable devices, smart healthcare technologies, and IoT systems—taking ideas from concept to reality through schematic design, firmware development, prototyping, and testing.

Currently, I work at Fluttercare, where I lead the development of smart wearable technology for monitoring baby well-being. My journey also includes managing lab operations at UBC, mentoring students, and contributing to high-impact research in wireless sensing and biomedical devices.

In both industry and academia, I believe in combining technical excellence, continuous learning, and collaborative spirit to solve meaningful problems and improve lives.
